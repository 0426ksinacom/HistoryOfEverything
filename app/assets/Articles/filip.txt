In one of the more embarrassing incidents of his life, __Filip Hracek__ got lost on his way to Flutter Live and almost didn't make it to the keynote. The exact location of this event is unknown to this day but it is generally believed that it happened somewhere very near the Science Museum — possibly just at the other side of the building.

According to witnesses, __Filip__ did not take handle the situation very well. His whimpering was clearly audible to onlookers. He did not ask for directions, and instead, he pretended to be "checking his phone" and "waiting for a friend", fooling absolutely no one.

After several minutes of this embarrassment, __Filip__ realized he owns a mobile phone and used the electronic map software package offered by his employer – appropriately named Google Maps. Showing great skill in zooming and panning around, he finally brought up the needed directions and followed them to the venue. He arrived 3 hours late, blaming traffic.
